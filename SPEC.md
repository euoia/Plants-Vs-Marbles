# Ants vs Marbles — Specification

A browser tower-defence game in the style of Plants vs Zombies. Ants climb a marble maze from the exit; the player defends by dropping different types of marbles into the maze.

- **Implementation:** single file, [index.html](./index.html) (HTML5 canvas + vanilla JS, no dependencies).
- **Run:** open `index.html` in any modern browser.

## 1. Objective

- **Lose:** any ant reaches the top of the maze.
- **Win:** the whole invasion schedule has spawned (including the final boss) and all ants are dead.

## 2. Playfield

- Vertical maze of **5 lanes** (100 px wide, 540 px long). Canvas is 900×700.
- **Top:** the marble chute (red line). Marbles are dropped in from here.
- **Bottom:** the exit, where ants enter. Marbles stop at the exit.
- Top bar: crumb counter, marble selector (11 slots incl. track pieces), eater, glove.
- Left side: invasion progress bar.

## 3. Resources — Crumbs

- Start with **150**.
- Crumbs fall from the sky every 7–10 s (worth 25, vanish after 10 s); click to collect.
- Gold marbles also produce crumbs (see below).

## 4. Marbles (defenders)

Each marble has a cost, health, cooldown (after placing one, that type is unavailable for a while) and a mass used for drop damage.

| Marble | Key | Cost | HP | Cooldown | Mass | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Gold | 1 | 50 | 100 | 5 s | 3 | Drops a 25-crumb pickup every 10 s |
| Shooter | 2 | 100 | 100 | 5 s | 3 | Fires a shot (25 dmg) down its lane every 1.4 s while an ant is below it |
| Frost | 3 | 175 | 100 | 5 s | 3 | Like Shooter, 20 dmg and slows the ant 50% for 3 s |
| Twin | 4 | 200 | 100 | 5 s | 5 | Fires two shots (25 dmg each) per volley |
| Steel | 5 | 50 | 900 | 15 s | 8 | Tough wall, heaviest drop damage |
| Bomb | 6 | 150 | 1 | 25 s | 2 | Explodes 0.8 s after touching an ant (or immediately if killed): kills every ant (including boss and armored) within 1.6 lanes sideways and 130 px vertically |
| Glass | 7 | 75 | 1 | 8 s | 4 | Shatters the moment it stops (lands on an ant or reaches the exit), doing normal drop damage. Leaves 8 shards across the lane; each cuts ants crawling over it for 14 dmg/s (ignores armor), lasts 30 s and wears out after dealing 90 damage |

### 4.1 Placing and rolling

- Select a marble (click slot or press 1–6), then click a lane. The marble is dropped from the **clicked height** (clamped to between the chute and just above the exit).
- It cannot be placed if unaffordable or on cooldown. Marbles do not collide with each other and can overlap freely.
- Marbles accelerate while falling (500 px/s², max 420 px/s, starting 75 px/s) toward the exit.
- A marble stops when it reaches the exit or touches an ant. Marbles pass through each other, **except** that they queue up (about 54 px apart) behind a marble that is stopped by an ant being chewed, until that marble dies or the ant is killed.
- Marbles are destroyed when HP reaches 0.

### 4.2 Drop (impact) damage

If a marble lands on an ant while still falling:

`damage = round(mass × fallDistance / 100)`

Higher drops and heavier marbles hurt more. Damage is shown as a floating number. The distance counts only the original drop, not later rolling.

### 4.4 Glove

Toggle with the glove button or **G**. Click a marble or track piece to pick it up, then click a lane/height to put it down (free). Marbles put down start rolling again with no drop damage. After putting an item down the glove has an **8 s cooldown** (shown on the button). Esc / right-click returns the held item without triggering the cooldown.

## 4a. Track pieces

Placed in a lane at the clicked height (same selector bar, keys 8, 9, 0 and -). Ants ignore them. Pieces trigger every time a marble passes over them while moving downward, so marbles can loop through a route indefinitely (e.g. ramp right → ramp left → spring). A piece re-arms for a marble once it has moved away from it.

| Piece | Key | Cost | Cooldown | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Spring | 8 | 75 | 2 s | Launches a marble back up to the top of the maze; it then falls again and gets a fresh drop for impact damage |
| Ramp ◀ | 9 | 25 | 1 s | Slides a marble into the lane to the left (not placeable in the leftmost lane) |
| Ramp ▶ | 0 | 25 | 1 s | Slides a marble into the lane to the right (not placeable in the rightmost lane) |
| Boost | - | 60 | 2 s | Accelerates a marble to 720 px/s (normal max 420) until it stops. A boosted marble that hits an ant gets +250 px of effective fall distance and ×1.5 impact damage |

Pieces can be chained to build routes and loops (e.g. ramp across, spring back up). Pieces can't be placed within 44 px of another piece in the same lane.

## 4b. Ant Eater (special weapon)

- Button in the top bar or key **E**. Free, but has a **90 s cooldown** (first available after 20 s).
- An anteater appears in every lane at the exit and sweeps up the maze (230 px/s), eating **every ant** it passes, including the boss. Ants that spawn during the sweep are eaten too.
- Marbles are unaffected.

## 5. Ants (attackers)

Ants spawn from a visible ant hill below the exit in a random lane. They spend a short moment digging out of the ground before climbing. When a marble blocks them they chew it (damage per second = `dmg`). Speeds below are in px/s before the global 0.8 speed scale.

| Ant | HP | Speed | DPS | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Basic | 100 | 9 | 20 | Standard |
| Fast | 60 | 18 | 15 | Small, quick |
| Tank | 350 | 6 | 25 | Large |
| Jumper (green) | 80 | 11 | 18 | Leaps over the first marble it meets (once) |
| Armored (grey) | 150 + 150 armor | 7 | 22 | Shots damage armor first (at 60%); bombs and drop damage ignore armor |
| Spitter (blue, shiny) | 90 | 8 | 15 | Stops 210 px away from a marble and spits venom every 2 s: 12 dmg + poison (7 dmg/s for 4 s) |
| Red | 600 | 3.5 | 90 | Huge, very slow, devastating bite |
| Swarm (brown) | 30 | 14 | 8 | Tiny; arrives in packs of 5 |
| Mite (tan) | 14 | 26 | 5 | Very small and fast; arrives in packs of 9 (free play from the ~9th ant) |
| Digger (clay) | 110 | 10 | 20 | When blocked by a marble it burrows for 1.4 s (immune to shots, bombs, shards, and passes under marbles) and resurfaces 170 px further up; can dig twice (free play from the ~15th ant) |
| Boss | 1500 | 4 | 60 | Used as the campaign finale |
| Queen | 6000 | 3 | 70 per lane | Free-play finale: spans all 5 lanes, chews a marble in every lane at once, spawns 3 swarm babies every 5 s (max 45 ants on screen). Bombs deal 500, the Ant Eater 1200 (once per sweep), instead of killing her outright |

Slowed ants move at half speed.

Defeated ants and marbles play a short fade/impact animation before being removed from the playfield.

## 6. Wave schedule

- First ant at 20 s. Each following ant arrives after `max(2.2, 9 − 0.12 × i)` seconds, for **60 ants**, then the Queen 10 s after the last.
- Type is rolled per ant, unlocking as the game progresses: fast (from #7), jumper (#10), swarm (#13), tank (#16), red (#19), armored (#21), spitter (#26).
- Every 20th ant is accompanied by 4 extra basic ants.

## 6a. Game modes

The main menu offers **Campaign** and **Free Play** (the full-length game above, everything unlocked).

Campaign is 10 short levels (~1 minute each). Each level starts with an intro screen listing what is new; marbles, ants, the glove (level 1) and the Ant Eater (level 3) are introduced gradually, and the bar only shows what has been unlocked so far. Level 1 has only the Shooter marble and basic ants; level 10 ends with the Queen. Campaign ants walk 25% faster, start with reduced health that scales up per level, and crumbs fall faster than in free play. Winning unlocks the next level (progress saved in localStorage); a **Main menu** button is available during play.
